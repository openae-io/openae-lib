# Get Started

## Install

The Python library can be easily installed with `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ openae
```

:::{important}
The package is currently hosted ony on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org) due to naming policy conflicts. We are trying to claim the project name `openae` for PyPI [here](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/5968). Hopefully, we can install the package with `pip install openae` from PyPI soon.
